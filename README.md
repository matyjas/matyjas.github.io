# a personal site

This here are the output files and source for a site called [Functional.systems](http://functional.systems) which used to be called [MaciejMatyjas.com](http://maciejmatyjas.com) and can be shortened to [funcsys.com](http://funcsys.com).

The source is in the [source directory](source). It is made of the following
* [Brunch](http://brunch.io)
* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

The current version of the site isn't really a `static` site, it is more like a `web app` in that it is driven by JavaScript and templating. One day, I hope to find a nice way to do this with Elm.
